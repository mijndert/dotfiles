Rusha [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/srijs/rusha.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/srijs/rusha)\n*A high-performance pure-javascript SHA1 implementation suitable for large binary data.*\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/rusha.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/rusha/)\n\n## Prologue: The Sad State of Javascript SHA1 implementations\n\nWhen we started experimenting with alternative upload technologies at [doctape](http://doctape.com) that required creating SHA1 hashes of the data locally on the client, it quickly became obvious that there were no performant pure-js implementations of SHA1 that worked correctly on binary data.\n\nJeff Mott's [CryptoJS](http://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/) and Brian Turek's [jsSHA](http://caligatio.github.com/jsSHA/) were both hash functions that worked correctly on ASCII strings of a small size, but didn't scale to large data and/or didn't work correctly with binary data.\n\n(On a sidenode, as of now Tim Caswell's [Cifre](http://github.com/openpeer/cifre) actually works with large binary data, as opposed to previously statet.)\n\nBy modifying Paul Johnston's [sha1.js](http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/sha1.html) slightly, it worked correctly on binary data but was unfortunately very slow, especially on V8. So a few days were invested on my side to implement a Johnston-inspired SHA1 hashing function with a heavy focus on performance.\n\nThe result of this process is Rusha, a SHA1 hash function that works flawlessly on large amounts binary data, such as binary strings or ArrayBuffers returned by the HTML5 File API, and leverages the soon-to-be-landed-in-firefox [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/) with whose support its within *half of native speed*!\n\n## Installing\n\n### Node.JS\n\nThere is really no point in doing this, since Node.JS already has a wonderful `crypto` module that is leveraging low-level hardware instructions to perform really nice. Your can see the comparison below in the benchmarks.\n\nRusha is available on [npm](http://npmjs.org/) via `npm install rusha`.\n\nIf you still want to do this, anyhow, just `require()` the `rusha.js` file, follow the instructions on _Using the Rusha Object_.\n\n### Browser\n\nRusha is available on [bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) via `bower install rusha`.\n\nIt is highly recommended to run CPU-intensive tasks in a [Web Worker](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_web_workers). To do so, just start a worker with `var worker = new Worker('rusha.js')` and start sending it jobs. Follow the instructions on _Using the Rusha Worker_.\n\nIf you can't, for any reason, use Web Workers, include the `rusha.js` file in a `<script>` tag and follow the instructions on _Using the Rusha Object_.\n\n## Using the Rusha Object\n\nYour instantiate a new Rusha object by doing `var r = new Rusha(optionalSizeHint)`. When created, it provides the following methods:\n\n- `Rusha#digest(d)`: Create a hex digest from data of the three kinds mentioned below, or throw and error if the type is unsupported.\n- `Rusha#digestFromString(s)`: Create a hex digest from a binary `String`. A binary string is expected to only contain characters whose charCode < 256.\n- `Rusha#digestFromBuffer(b)`: Create a hex digest from a `Buffer` or `Array`. Both are expected to only contain elements < 256.\n- `Rusha#digestFromArrayBuffer(a)`: Create a hex digest from an `ArrayBuffer` object.\n- `Rusha#rawDigest(d)`: Behaves just like #digest(d), except that it returns the digest as an Int32Array of size 5.\n\n## Using the Rusha Worker\n\nYou can send your instance of the web worker messages in the format `{id: jobid, data: dataobject}`. The worker then sends back a message in the format `{id: jobid, hash: hash}`, were jobid is the id of the job previously received and hash is the hash of the data-object you passed, be it a `Blob`, `Array`, `Buffer`, `ArrayBuffer` or `String`.\n\n## Development\n\n* Download npm dependencies with `npm install`\n* Source file to be edited is `rusha.sweet.js`\n* Build with `npm run build`\n* Run tests with `npm test`\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nTested were my Rusha implementation, the sha1.js implementation by [P. A. Johnston](http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/sha1.html), Tim Caswell's [Cifre](http://github.com/openpeer/cifre) and the Node.JS native implementation.\n\nIf you want to check the performance for yourself in your own browser, I compiled a [JSPerf Page](http://jsperf.com/rusha/13).\n\nA normalized estimation based on the best results for each implementation, smaller is better:\n![rough performance graph](http://srijs.github.io/rusha/bench/unscientific01.png)\n\nResults per Implementation and Platform:\n![performance chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/oimg?key=0Ag9CYh5kHpegdDB1ZG16WU1xVFgxdjRuQUVwQXRnWVE&oid=1&zx=pcatr2aits9)\n\nAll tests were performed on a MacBook Air 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 and 4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"srijs","email":"recv@awesam.de"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-02-26T20:21:54.928Z","created":"2013-03-25T15:26:43.887Z","0.6.0":"2013-03-25T15:26:47.142Z","0.6.1":"2013-04-08T12:01:01.756Z","0.7.0":"2013-05-22T09:52:44.165Z","0.7.1":"2013-10-03T22:56:47.871Z","0.7.2":"2013-10-25T20:55:57.200Z","0.7.3":"2014-02-12T11:49:12.307Z","0.7.4":"2014-02-25T03:22:58.125Z","0.7.5":"2014-09-04T13:31:59.487Z","0.7.6":"2014-09-04T13:39:35.805Z","0.7.7":"2014-09-06T10:22:56.346Z","0.7.8":"2015-01-08T10:14:43.324Z","0.8.0":"2015-01-11T01:57:58.385Z","0.8.1":"2015-01-16T23:20:07.691Z","0.8.2":"2015-02-26T13:36:00.700Z","0.8.3":"2015-06-22T05:43:11.197Z","0.8.4":"2016-09-18T08:00:30.663Z","0.8.5":"2016-11-25T07:17:44.555Z"},"author":{"name":"Sam Rijs"},"users":{"chrisdickinson":true,"matthiasg":true,"sballan":true,"jameskyburz":true},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/srijs/rusha.git"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","keywords":["sha1","binary","crypto","hash"],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/srijs/rusha/issues"},"license":"MIT","homepage":"https://github.com/srijs/rusha#readme","_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"58b338e2-5e2a\"","_lastModified":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 20:21:54 GMT"}
