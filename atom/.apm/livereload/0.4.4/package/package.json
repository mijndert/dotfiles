As soon as you save a file, it is preprocessed as needed, and the browser is refreshed.\n>\n> Even cooler, when you change a CSS file or an image, the browser is updated instantly without reloading the page.\n>\n> *from LiveReload official site*\n\n## Usage\n1. Select main menu `Packages > LiveReload > Toggle Server` to turn the server on. Or press `Ctrl+Shift+R`.\n2. When the server started successfully, `LiveReload: PORT_NUMBER` text appears in the status bar(see the bottom right panel in the following screenshot).\n   ![LiveReload status text](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/212034/3565696/c50f01ce-0aca-11e4-991e-4cb8475364c4.png)\n3. Click it to get the url of `livereload.js` JavaScript file.\n4. Put the script into the bottom of documents you want to give power of live reloading.\n\n## Features\n* Reloads web pages when any file is created, removed or modified.\n* Applies changes without reloading when any CSS or image changed.\n* Works well with [Chrome LiveReload extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en).\n\n## Notes\n* The chrome extension works only with default port 35729.\n* Watching too many files can make this horribly slow. To avoid this please exclude directories which have many files such as `node_modules`.\n\n## Todo\n* Setting per project.\n* Support preprocessors.\n\n## License\nMIT\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"livereload@0.4.4","_shasum":"83ffa392ab2acff8e1f61507d9f387d32c0c9cab","_resolved":"file:../d-117231-19241-fdj5wl/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117231-19241-fdj5wl/package.tgz"}
