# Atom Solarized Dark UI theme

My personal take on a full solarized feel for Atom, recommended for use with the
[Solarized Dark Syntax](https://github.com/atom/solarized-dark-syntax) theme. This package is not under active development (I recommmend the built in "One Dark" and "One Light" themes), but I'm happy to review pull requests.
